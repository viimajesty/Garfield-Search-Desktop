# Garfield-Search-Desktop
Garfield Search Desktop is a BATCH tool that allows you to search for certain words in the Garfield Comic Strip. 

Garfield Search Desktop uses https://lasagna.cz/ for searching the thousands of Garfield Strips. 

I am neither affiliated with Garfield nor with Lasagna.cz. 

The file is BATCH file, which will only work on Windows 2000 and above. 
As it is a BATCH file, Windows will warn you that the file is not safe and should not be opened. 
But the file is entirely safe to use. 

Thank you.
